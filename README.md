# TTP223-RelayControl
Using a touch key, we will change the status of the relay module, and in the meantime, the current status of the module will be displayed on the oled display.

## What it DO!
You have probably encountered the case in various trainings that control different electrical devices using relays, but the question is how to control this relay in the most beautiful way ?! Well, in this tutorial, we will change the status of the relay module using a touch key, and in the meantime, the current status of the module will be displayed on the oled display.


### Items needed
-TTP223
-Relay Module
-Arduino Nano
-Oled 0.96

### Required libraries
-Adafruit_SSD1306
-Adafruit_GFX
-Wire
-SPI

## Conclusion
In this project, with a few simple modules, including the TTP223 touch module and Oled display, touch sensor, relay module, and of course, using the Arduino board, we built a touch control device for electrical appliances.
